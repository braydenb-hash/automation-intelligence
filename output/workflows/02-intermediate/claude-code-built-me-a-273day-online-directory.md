## Step-by-Step

1. **[Manual Research]** Identify directory niche and data sources
   - Research profitable directory niches (funeral homes, senior living, gas prices, etc.) that have strong lead generation or advertising potential
2. **[Claude Code]** Use Claude Code to build directory structure
   - Prompt Claude Code to generate the website architecture, database schema, and frontend interface for the directory
3. **[Claude Code]** Data collection and enrichment
   - Use Claude Code to scrape, aggregate, and enrich data from various sources. This is described as the hardest and most valuable part of the process
4. **[Claude Code]** Data cleaning and validation
   - Clean and validate collected data to ensure quality and accuracy for the directory listings
5. **[WordPress]** Deploy directory website
   - Deploy the directory on WordPress or similar platform to generate organic traffic on autopilot
6. **[Manual Setup]** Implement monetization strategy
   - Set up lead generation forms, advertising integrations, or develop complementary vertical SaaS products

## When to Use This

- Building passive income businesses with limited capital ($200-1000)
- Creating data-driven websites that generate organic traffic
- Establishing a traffic base before building SaaS products
- Entering markets with strong lead generation potential (senior living, funeral homes, local services)
- Building vertical SaaS businesses with built-in customer acquisition

- When you need immediate revenue (directories take time to build traffic)
- In highly saturated directory markets without unique data angles
- When you cannot access or legally scrape quality data sources
- If you lack patience for SEO and organic growth strategies

## Alternatives

- Manual directory building with no-code tools like Webflow or Bubble
- Using existing directory templates and plugins for WordPress
- Building directories with traditional web development instead of AI coding
- Purchasing existing directories and improving them
- Using specialized directory builders like Brilliant Directories
